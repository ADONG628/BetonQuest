BetonQuest is advanced and powerful quests plugin. It doesn't follow traditional
convention, where "quest" is a closed structure object, which can have a set of
tasks, events and rewards on completion. Instead, BetonQuest introduces the net
of objectives which can under certain conditions trigger events, start new
objectives or change NPC's attitude to the player. Of course grouping this all
together and saying "this group is a quest" is still possible.

## Compiling the plugin

You need to have JDK for version 1.7 or above and Maven installed. Download
BetonQuest source code to some directory and issue command `mvn package`
inside it. The .jar package should appear in _target_ directory.
