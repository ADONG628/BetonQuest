v1.5
Changes:
    * Added support for MythicMobs and Vault (see wiki for more info)
    * AutoUpdater is now enabled by default! If you want you can change this and reload the
      plugin, nothing will be downloaded in that case
    * Books saving format has changed. All books were automatically converted, but you need to check them if
      everything looks like it's supposed to.
    * Command event accepts multiple commands separated by "|", eg. "command say beton|say quest"
    * Event command now accepts optional <name> argument at the end; this will fire event for <name> player.
      eg. "/q event wood_reward Steve"
    * Added aliases for /q command: bq, bquest, bquests, betonquest, betonquests, quest, quests
    * Added aliases for /j command: bj, journal, bjournal, betonjournal
    * Objectives are now defined directly in event instruction, not in objectives.yml (which
      was deleted, if you want to restore something check the backup)
    * Replies in conversations are now optionally clickable (tellraw option in config.yml)
    * Added permission for starting a conversation: betonquest.conversation
    * Conversation starting/ending, updating journal, plugin's update and full inventory can now make
      sounds; you can find a list of possible values here: jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Sound.html
    * Conditions for events are now defined as 'event_conditions:' instead of simply 'conditions:'. This is
      to distinguish conditions for objectives and for events, as both of them can exist in one instruction
    * Updater is now run when disabling the plugin (it does matter if your server restarts every night)
Notes:
- All Objective events has been converted to new format. The objectives.yml file has been deleted, so if
  it contained any objectives that weren't covered by an event they may seem lost. However there is a backup file
  and you can easily extract everything from it. Please refer to the wiki to learn how objectives are now defined
  or just study converted ones (it's pretty straightforward).
- AutoUpdater is now enabled by default. Every future update will be working exactly like before, all changes
  will be automaticly updated by a converter, there is always a backup and you are informed about all changes in
  this file. So it's pretty safe to say that keeping this plugin up to date won't give you any trouble. If you
  don't want to have latest fixex and features you can disable updating but this will make the developer sad.
- Because of changes in how books behave since 1.8 you may experience some strange bugs with saving books
  to items.yml. Generally you should open a book before saving it using /q item command. And don't start or end
  your books with " character, as it's part of a workaround of this bug/feature.

v1.4.3
Removed debug messages from ActionObjective. You could have told me, any of you guys...

v1.4.2
Really fixed an updater.

v1.4.1
Fixed few bugs in Action objective.
Fixed updater, hopefully.

v1.4
Changes:
    * Conversations are now divided into multiple files in "conversations" directory
    * Items are now saved to items.yml file and referenced by "take", "give", "item" and "hand" events/conditions
    * Added /q item <itemID> command which saves currently held item to the config as specified itemID
    * Added location to Action objective, which checks the location of the block (unlike location condition which checks location of the player)
    * Added /q event <eventID> command which fires specified event
    * Fixed multiple bugs with conversation starting and ending
    * Block NPCs can now be used with Citizens enabled
    * Added NPCKill objective for killing NPCs
    * Added SetBlock event for setting a block at specified location
    * Improved Material matching in configs
    * Modified Action objective for greater flexibility:
      - It is now possible to detect clicking in air
      - It is no longer possible to detect clicking on any block (as this accepts clicking on air)
      - Can be used to detect book reading (with help of updated Hand condition)
    * Added AutoUpdater; it's disabled by default
Notes:
  Conversion of configuration should have been done automatically, you don't have to worry about anything. If something went wrong you can revert changes from generated backup file, which contains all your previous configs.
  You can enable AutoUpdater by setting "autoupdate" to true in config.yml. It is completely safe because all next versions will generate backups and convert all files automatically. You will be notified on joining the server about new changelog file.
  Please refer to the wiki for changes in formatting instruction strings for various things: https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/wiki
  You probably should also change names of converted items to something else than "item12". But that works too of course.

v1.3
Changes:
    * UUID support (optional)
    * NPCs made from a clay block, head and sign, for servers without Citizens2 plugin
    * Global, long and persistent delay for events (as an objective)
    * Folder event for multiple events, with optional short delay
    * French translation (thanks to fastlockel)
If you want to convert names to UUIDs run the plugin once and then change in the config "uuid: false" to true. Do not touch the "convert: true" option unless you want your database wiped! Conversion will happen on next plugin reload (eg. /q reload). This is not revertable!
Remember to backup your config files before updating! It shouldn't destroy anything but you never know.

v1.2
Global locations now automatically run only once, no need for blocking it with tags and conditions. They use however tags that follow the syntax "global_<tag>", where <tag> is global location objective tag.
Added optional respawn location for cancelled death objective, just add "respawn:100.5;200;300.5;world;90;0" to instruction string.
Added german translation, thanks to coalaa!
Added optional movement blocking while in conversation, just add option "stop: true" or "stop: false" in every conversation.
Changed priority of conversation chat event to lowest, should work even for muted players.
Fixed data values in block objective.
Added metrics, you can disable them by setting "metrics: false" in config.yml
Added support for SQLite, plugin will use it when connecting to MySQL fails.
Fixed death objective not working every time and not removing all effects.

v1.1
Fixed many bugs including but not limited to:
    * negated conjunction condition
    * unnecessary debug messages
    * not working global locations
Replaced config examples with default quest
Leaving data values in item's definition will make plugin ignore data value in most cases
Improved journal to stop text leaks
Item names now replace _ with spaces

v1.0
Initial release
