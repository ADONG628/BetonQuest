Being able to write quests with BetonQuest is a valuable skill since you can make most admins dreams come true.
BetonQuest is not only limited to quests but can also be used in combination with the Denizen or Skript plugins that allow you to create 
things that would only be possible by coding your own plugin.

Learning how to use BetonQuest is not super easy since it is quite complex due to its enormous flexibility.
This website provides great learning material that will help you on your journey to become a good quester.
