BetonQuest is an advanced and powerful quest plugin. 
It offers RPG-style conversations with NPCs and a very flexible quest system.
The _**multi-path conversations**_ can be displayed in many ways ranging from basic clickable chat output, to all-new technologies.
BetonQuest is not limited to simple, repetitive quests but can also power highly flexible quests
that have never been seen before. This is made possible by _**support for more than 20 other plugins**_ such as
Citizens, Heroes, JobsReborn, Magic, McMMO and MythicMobs. You can also interact with other quest plugins
such as "Quests" to maintain compatibility with existing Quests on your server.

However, _**^^BetonQuest is not made for intense scripting^^**_! You can write player based scripts with BetonQuest but
_**we support hooking into Denizen and Skript for a reason**_!
These plugins allow for far more comfortable (server) scripting!
