### Sound
This IO just plays a sound. You can use it's options in any other IO.
You should read the <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands/playsound" target="_blank">wiki page</a> of the playsound command
as Minecraft's sound system is kinda strange. Just one example: Sound never moves in Minecraft. It's totally static.
Keep that in mind when creating sounds close to a player. They can move around the sound and make it louder or quieter by walking towards / away from it.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| sound | Sound to play. If blank, no sound. Either vanilla Minecraft sounds (get them using /playsound autocompletion) or the name of a sound from a resource pack. |
| soundcategory | The <a href="https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/SoundCategory.html" target="_blank">category</a> in which the sound will be played. |
| soundvolume | Minecraft's <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands/playsound#Arguments" target="_blank">special sound volume</a>. Default: _1_ |
| soundpitch | Pitch of the sound. Default: _1_ Min: _0_ Max: _2_ |
| soundlocation | Default: The player's location. A location using the BetonQuest [ULF](../Reference/#unified-location-formating). Can include variables. |
| soundplayeroffset | This option is special. See below.

<h3>soundplayeroffset:</h3>
This option can be a number or a vector.

**Number**:

The location the sound will be played at is moved away from the player towards the `soundlocation` using the number from
`soundplayeroffset`.
The sound will be at the actual location if the player is closer to the soundlocation then the offset would allow.

??? info "Visual Explanation"  
    ![offset image](../media/content/User-Documentation/Notifications/offset.png)

    This shows how the sound will be placed at the `soundlocation` if the distance between the player and the `soundlocation`
    is smaller then the `playeroffset`:    
    ![offsetBiggerThanDistance image](../media/content/User-Documentation/Notifications/offsetBiggerThanDistance.png)

*Example usage*:

You could make a "sound compass" that will play a sound in the direction of a point of interest.


**Vector**:     
A vector has to be in the format`(x;y;z)`. This system will use the players relative coordinate system.
This means that the vectors x axis is right / left from the players head, the y axis is up or down from where ever the players face is
and the z axis is before / behind the players face. It will move along the players  head.

??? info "Visual Explanation"  
    ![relativeAxis image](../media/content/User-Documentation/Notifications/relativeAxis.png)

This makes it possible to go crazy with sounds. Just one example: A halloween special
where the player hears a :ghost: whispering into his left ear - no matter where he is or how he turns his head... ðŸŽƒ

Here is a small example:

blue line = direction the player is looking in    
ðŸŸ¢ = soundlocation argument    
ðŸ”´  = the actual location the sound is played at    
*soundplayeroffset = (0,0,5)*

<video controls loop
src="../../media/content/User-Documentation/Notifications/RelativeVectorExample.mp4"
width="780" height="500">
Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>



The sound is always played 5 block away from the soundlocation. The direction is however based on where the player is looking.

### Suppress
Does not output any sound or text ðŸ”•. Can be used to remove "miscellaneous" notifications.


###Categories
These are all notification categories. The categories `error` and `info` are super-categories that allow you to change
the default values for all notification with just two entries in your *custom.yml*. You can still override these settings by providing a specific
setting for any normal category.

This means you can show all notifications using the actionbar while having a bossbar
IO for the "language changed" category with just three entries in you custom.yml!
