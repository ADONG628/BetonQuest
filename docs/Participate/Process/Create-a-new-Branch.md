A new branch should always be created from an up to date `master` branch.
For that you [added the BetonQuest repositry](../Setup-Project.md#adding-remote-repository) `upstream`.
Now you click on your current branch in the right bottom corner, probably `master`.
Then you click on `upstream/master` and click on `New Branch from Selected...`.
Now give the branch a name that describes the changes you want to make and click `CREATE`.
