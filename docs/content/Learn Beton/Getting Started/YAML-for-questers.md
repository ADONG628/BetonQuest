##YAML Syntax
Before we can start you need to understand the fundamentals of YAML.
You have no idea what that is? Well YAML is the format most plugins store their config data in!
Its key:value based which means that you will always have to name the thing that you write down before you actually
write it down. Let me show you an example:
    Icon design
!!! example "YAML Key:Value"
        ```YAML
        key: "value"
        name: "your thing"
        ```
These keys and values can also be nested into each other:
!!! ""


YAML also cares a lot about spaces and tabs! You are not allowed to use tabs in your YAML files at all. You have to
 use spaces though.
