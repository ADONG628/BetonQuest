##Quick Edits

Quick changes can be made by clicking the pencil icon at the top of each page. This lets you edit the docs directly in 
your browser. The [Guidelines](Guidelines.md) still apply!
 
##Advanced Edits

More advanced edits can be done with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/" target="_blank"> IntelliJ</a> 
or any other IDEA. 
This guide will show the process with IntelliJ and includes some neat tricks that are exclusive to IntelliJ.
