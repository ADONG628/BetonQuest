#Contributing

First of all, thank you for looking at this page! :smile:

You have numerous options to contribute to BetonQuest. 
Check this list to see what fits your skills:

##Reporting bugs
You just need to follow the bug report template on GitHub to submit a bug report. Please give us __**all information that is requested in the template!**__

##Suggesting features
Before you suggest a feature please make sure it does not already exist! Search in the docs and if you are not sure ask in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rK6mfHq" target="_blank">discord!</a> 
Once you are sure the feature does not already exist please also make sure nobody has already suggested it. Both things will save us time and therefore make it possible
to implement more features.

Once you did that too simply <a href="https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuest/issues/new?template=feature_request_template.md" target="_blank">
open a new issue on GitHub</a>. Maybe someday someone will find the time to make your dream come true. **:man_mage:**
